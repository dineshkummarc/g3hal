# G3 HAL

[G3][1] HAL is a basic node.js web application that is used to control [MPD][2] 
and provide a few other basic services for running an automated internet
radio jukebox system.

Configuration information is expected to be in a config.json file in the 
base server directory. Look at the config.json.example file for an idea of
what settings there are.
